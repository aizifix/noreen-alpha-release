Success Criteria
Organizer portal
- Organizer portal accept or reject logic
- I have that logic but it was remove for some reason
- During event builder admin assigns organizer or later -> whoever gets to be assigned then that organizer can accept or reject later -> then they can view those events and be active -> status change to either (pending, accept or reject)

Note
- Do not change any API endpoints.
- The api folder is copy-pasted in another window; use only as reference.
- Do not alter other areas; changes are strictly limited to this context.
