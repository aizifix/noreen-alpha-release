# Supplier Inclusions Enhancement

## Overview
Enhanced the Components step (Step 5) in the Event Builder to include a dedicated **Supplier Inclusions** section with proper modal functionality and separate cost calculation.

## Changes Made

### 1. **New Supplier Inclusions Tab**
- Added a third tab to the Components step specifically for suppliers
- Suppliers are now displayed separately from Noreen Components and Venue Inclusions
- Shows a badge count of added suppliers in the tab label

### 2. **Enhanced UI Features**

#### Supplier Tab Features:
- **Clean separation**: Suppliers are grouped by category with blue-themed styling
- **Detailed supplier cards**: Each supplier shows:
  - Supplier name and category badge
  - Contact information (email, phone)
  - Pricing tier selected
  - Toggle to include/exclude from event
  - Edit and delete buttons
- **Empty state**: Beautiful empty state encouraging users to add their first supplier
- **Quick add button**: Prominent "Add Supplier" button at the top

#### Modal Functionality:
- Existing `SupplierSelectionModal` is now fully active
- Two-column layout:
  - Left: Available suppliers list
  - Right: Pricing tiers for selected supplier
- Real-time tier selection with pricing preview
- Confirmation before adding to event

### 3. **Separate Cost Calculation**

#### New Helper Functions:
```typescript
calculateSupplierCosts()     // Calculates total supplier costs
calculateNoreenComponents()  // Calculates Noreen components only (excluding suppliers)
calculateCompleteTotal()     // Calculates complete event cost including all components
```

#### Budget Display:
- **Noreen Components tab** now shows detailed breakdown:
  - Noreen Components subtotal
  - Supplier Inclusions subtotal (if any)
  - Total Event Cost
- **Supplier Inclusions tab** shows:
  - Total Supplier Costs in a highlighted summary box

### 4. **Data Flow**
- Suppliers are stored as components with an `assignedSupplier` property
- Supplier data includes:
  - Supplier ID and offer ID for database tracking
  - Supplier price (from selected pricing tier)
  - Full supplier contact details
  - Category assignment
- All supplier costs are properly included in:
  - Event total budget
  - Payment calculations
  - Invoice generation

### 5. **Visual Design**
- **Green theme**: Noreen Components (maintaining existing style)
- **Blue theme**: Supplier Inclusions (new, distinct visual identity)
- **Consistent UI**: All tabs follow the same layout patterns
- **Better organization**: Clear separation makes it easier to manage different types of inclusions

## Benefits
