# Comprehensive Activity Logging System Implementation

## Overview

A complete activity logging system has been implemented to track ALL user activities across your event management platform. This system logs every significant action from login/logout to event creation, payments, bookings, and more.

## What's Been Implemented

### 1. Database Infrastructure

**File:** `app/api/migrations/comprehensive_activity_logging.sql`

Created comprehensive logging tables:

- **`tbl_user_activity_logs`** - Main activity log table for all user actions
- **`tbl_payment_activity_logs`** - Detailed payment tracking
- **`tbl_event_activity_logs`** - Event-specific activities
- **`tbl_booking_activity_logs`** - Booking lifecycle tracking
- **`tbl_system_activity_logs`** - Administrative and system actions
- **`vw_activity_timeline`** - Unified view combining all activity logs

### 2. Activity Logger Class

**File:** `app/api/ActivityLogger.php`

Core logging class with methods:

- `logActivity()` - General activity logging
- `logAuth()` - Authentication events (login/logout/signup)
- `logEvent()` - Event-related activities
- `logBooking()` - Booking operations
- `logPayment()` - Payment transactions
- `logVenue()` - Venue management
- `logPackage()` - Package operations
- `logSupplier()` - Supplier activities
- `logOrganizer()` - Organizer actions
- `logClient()` - Client activities
- `logSystem()` - System/admin operations
- `getActivityTimeline()` - Retrieve activity history
- `getActivityStats()` - Analytics and statistics

### 3. Enhanced Authentication Logging

**File:** `app/api/auth.php`

Logs all authentication activities:

- ✅ User login attempts (successful and failed)
- ✅ User logouts
- ✅ New user registrations
- ✅ Password changes
- ✅ OTP verifications
- ✅ Failed login reasons

### 4. Admin Activity Logging

**File:** `app/api/admin.php`

Comprehensive admin action logging:

- ✅ Event creation and management
- ✅ Payment processing and confirmations
- ✅ Booking status updates
- ✅ Venue creation and updates
- ✅ Package management
- ✅ Organizer account creation
- ✅ Supplier management
- ✅ Settings changes

### 5. Client Activity Logging

**File:** `app/api/client.php`

Client action tracking:

- ✅ Booking creation
- ✅ Package selection
- ✅ Venue browsing
- ✅ Payment submissions
- ✅ Profile updates

### 6. Organizer Activity Logging

**Updated in:** `app/api/admin.php`

Organizer-specific tracking:

- ✅ Account creation
- ✅ Event offer acceptance/rejection
- ✅ Event management
- ✅ Client interactions

### 7. Supplier Activity Logging

**File:** `app/api/supplier.php`

Supplier action monitoring:

- ✅ Offer creation
- ✅ Offer updates
- ✅ Document uploads
- ✅ Profile management
- ✅ Service listings

### 8. Enhanced Reports Page

**File:** `app/(authenticated)/admin/reports/page.tsx`

Comprehensive reporting interface with:

- **Activity Timeline Tab:** Shows all system activities
- **Session Management Tab:** Active sessions and user tracking
- **Session Analytics Tab:** Login/logout statistics and trends

Features:

- Real-time activity feed
- Advanced filtering by action type
- User role filtering
- Date range selection
- Pagination support
- Color-coded action types
- Icon indicators for different activities
- Session duration tracking
- Failed login monitoring

## Activity Types Tracked

- `email_sent` - Email notifications
- `report_generated` - Report generation

## How to Apply the Migration

1. **Run the Migration Script:**

   ```bash
   php app/api/run_activity_logging_migration.php
   ```

2. **Verify Installation:**
   The script will:

   - Create all necessary tables
   - Set up views and indexes
   - Run a test log entry
   - Verify the system is working

3. **Check the Reports Page:**
   Navigate to `/admin/reports` to see:
   - Real-time activity timeline
   - Session analytics
   - User activity patterns

## Benefits of the New System

1. **Complete Audit Trail**

   - Every action is logged with timestamp
   - User identification for all activities
   - IP address tracking for security

2. **Enhanced Security**

   - Monitor failed login attempts
   - Track suspicious activities
   - Session management capabilities

3. **Business Intelligence**

   - User behavior analytics
   - Peak usage times
   - Feature utilization metrics

4. **Compliance & Accountability**

   - Complete audit logs for compliance
   - User action history
   - Payment transaction trails

5. **Debugging & Support**
   - Detailed activity history for troubleshooting
   - User session tracking
   - Error pattern identification

## Metadata Captured

Each log entry captures:

- **User Information:** ID, name, role, email
- **Action Details:** Type, category, description
- **Timing:** Timestamp, duration (for sessions)
- **Context:** Related entity (event/booking/payment ID)
- **Technical:** IP address, user agent, session ID
- **Status:** Success/failure, error reasons
- **Metadata:** Additional JSON data for context

## Performance Considerations

- Optimized indexes for fast querying
- Separate tables for different activity types
- Unified view for comprehensive reporting
- Pagination support for large datasets
- Automatic cleanup of old logs (can be configured)

## Future Enhancements

Potential additions:

- Export logs to CSV/Excel
- Real-time activity notifications
- Advanced analytics dashboards
- Machine learning for anomaly detection
- Automated alert systems
- Log archival strategies

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues:

1. **Tables Already Exist Error:**

   - This is normal if running migration multiple times
   - The system will continue to work

2. **Permission Errors:**

   - Ensure database user has CREATE TABLE permissions
   - Check file permissions for PHP scripts

3. **Logs Not Appearing:**
   - Verify ActivityLogger is properly initialized
   - Check database connection
   - Review PHP error logs

## Support

The comprehensive logging system is now fully integrated and will automatically track all activities. No additional configuration is required - simply use the application normally and all actions will be logged.

For any issues or questions, check the activity logs in the Reports section for detailed information about system operations.
