Success Criteria

- Event builder process when picking organizers
- Make sure when picking them, a button send request will be available
- then all status of the chosen organizers are going to be set to pending
- organizer will then get notified in their portal
- notification to accept or reject the offer
- add view details of the event as well
- plotting the date as well for that organizer
- organizer can then reject or accept
- whoever accepts first gets accepted in that admin request to be assigned
- default if no one accepts or no organizer accepts then the admin can still proceed with the drafted event and will wait further
- if no one accepts then in the event details, the admin can change the organizer
- let's then add organizers in the events [id] page
