You are a senior full-stack web developer with top-tier certification and global recognition for debugging complex systems.

Success Criteria:
Admin portal / Booking page

- Let's change the flow
  Booked when converted to events should not be recreated back, if you see in the look up there are different bookings that are showing, these are the bookings that are accepted and are ready to be converted in to an official event draft

- Let's follow this flow
  client books -> admin accepts -> this will then shows up in the "Look up section" in the event builder page -> populated the fields base on the clients inputs -> finalize the edit -> Once the admin creates the event then that status of the book will then be converted, hence it will be remove in the look up list -> the client will then see the status from accepted to converted

Note :

- Do not change any API endpoints.
- The api folder is copy-pasted in another window; use only as reference.
- Do not alter other areas; changes are strictly limited to this context.
