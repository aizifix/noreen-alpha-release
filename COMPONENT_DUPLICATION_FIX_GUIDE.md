# Component Duplication Fix Guide

## Problem Identified

The database table `tbl_package_components` contains duplicate entries for the same components within packages, particularly package 15. This causes the event builder to display multiple identical components.

## Root Cause

1. **Database Level**: Multiple identical components are stored in `tbl_package_components` table
2. **Backend API**: Component insertion logic didn't prevent duplicates during package creation/updates
3. **Frontend**: No deduplication logic when displaying components from API

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Database Cleanup ✅

**File**: `fix_duplicate_components.sql`

- Removes all duplicate components from `tbl_package_components`
- Keeps only unique components based on name + price combination
- Resets display order to be sequential

**Usage**: Run this SQL script on your database to clean existing duplicates.

### 2. Backend API Fixes ✅

#### Fixed `createPackage()` function:

- Added duplicate detection during component insertion
- Uses component name + price as unique key
- Logs when duplicates are skipped
- Sequential display order based on processed count

#### Fixed `updatePackage()` function:

- Same duplicate prevention logic as createPackage
- Validates and trims component names
- Proper type casting for prices

### 3. Frontend Deduplication ✅

**File**: `app/(authenticated)/admin/event-builder/page.tsx`

- Added Map-based deduplication when loading package components
- Uses component name + price as unique identifier
- Ensures only unique components are displayed in event builder

## Verification Steps

1. **Run the SQL cleanup script**:

   ```sql
   SOURCE fix_duplicate_components.sql;
   ```

2. **Test package creation**:

   - Create a new package with components
   - Verify no duplicates are inserted

3. **Test package editing**:

   - Edit an existing package's components
   - Verify duplicates are prevented

4. **Test event builder**:
   - Select a package in event builder
   - Verify components display without duplicates

## Expected Results

After applying all fixes:

- Package 14: Should have unique components only
- Package 15: Should show ~8-10 unique components instead of 70+ duplicates
- Event builder: Should display clean, unique component lists
- Future packages: Will automatically prevent duplicate components

## Files Modified

1. `fix_duplicate_components.sql` - Database cleanup script
2. `app/api/admin.php` - Backend duplicate prevention
3. `app/(authenticated)/admin/event-builder/page.tsx` - Frontend deduplication

## Workflow Impact

The fix maintains the original workflow:

1. Client books → Admin confirms booking
2. Confirmed bookings populate event builder fields
3. Packages with venues and components work correctly
4. No duplicate components displayed or saved

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] SQL script removes duplicates
- [ ] Package creation prevents duplicates
- [ ] Package editing prevents duplicates
- [ ] Event builder shows unique components
- [ ] Component prices and names display correctly
- [ ] Venue inclusions work properly
