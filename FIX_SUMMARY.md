# Reservation Fee System - Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed

The booking-to-event conversion was not tracking reservation fees. When a booking with payments was converted to an event, the `reserved_payment_total` and `adjusted_total` fields remained at `0.00`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Backend (PHP)
**Files:** `app/api/admin.php`, `app/api/staff.php`

- ‚úÖ Added automatic calculation of reservation fees from booking payments
- ‚úÖ Updated event creation to store `reserved_payment_total` and `adjusted_total`
- ‚úÖ System now queries booking payments and sums completed/paid amounts
- ‚úÖ Adjusted total is calculated as: total_budget - reserved_payment_total

### 2. Frontend (TypeScript/React)
**File:** `app/(authenticated)/admin/events/[id]/page.tsx`

- ‚úÖ Enhanced Payment Summary to display stored reservation fee values
- ‚úÖ Falls back to calculating from payment history if needed
- ‚úÖ Changed label from "Reserved Fee" to "Reservation Fee"
- ‚úÖ Added debug logging for troubleshooting

### 3. Database Migration
**File:** `app/api/migrations/fix_existing_reserved_payments.sql`

- ‚úÖ SQL script to update existing events that were converted before the fix
- ‚úÖ Retroactively calculates and updates reservation fee values
- ‚úÖ Includes verification query

## How It Works Now

### Booking Flow
```
1. Client creates booking ‚Üí status: pending
2. Admin adds reservation payment ‚Üí status: reserved
3. Admin confirms booking ‚Üí status: confirmed
4. Admin converts to event ‚Üí status: converted
   - System automatically calculates reservation fees
   - Stores in event.reserved_payment_total
   - Calculates event.adjusted_total
```

### Payment Summary Display
```
Total Budget:       ‚Ç±85,000.00
Reservation Fee:    ‚Ç±5,000.00   ‚Üê Now shows correctly!
Down Payment:       ‚Ç±25,000.00
Total Paid:         ‚Ç±30,000.00
Remaining Balance:  ‚Ç±55,000.00
```

## Fix Existing Events

Run this SQL script to update events created before the fix:

```bash
# In phpMyAdmin or MySQL Workbench, execute:
event-planning-system/app/api/migrations/fix_existing_reserved_payments.sql
```

This will update all events with their correct reservation fee amounts.

## Verify It's Working

### Quick Check - Database
```sql
SELECT
    event_id,
    event_title,
    original_booking_reference,
    total_budget,
    reserved_payment_total,  -- Should be > 0 if booking had payments
    adjusted_total            -- Should be total_budget - reserved_payment_total
FROM tbl_events
WHERE original_booking_reference IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY created_at DESC
LIMIT 10;
```

### Quick Check - Frontend
1. Open an event that was converted from a booking
2. Look at the Payment Summary section
3. "Reservation Fee" should appear if booking had payments
4. Check browser console for "Payment Summary Debug" logs

## Your Specific Case

Based on your data:

**Event ID 256 (Jaruda):**
- Booking Reference: BK-20251025-3982
- Current State: `reserved_payment_total: 0.00` ‚ùå
- After Migration: Should show actual reservation amount ‚úÖ

**To fix this event immediately:**
```sql
-- Run the migration script, OR manually update:
UPDATE tbl_events e
JOIN tbl_bookings b ON e.original_booking_reference = b.booking_reference
LEFT JOIN (
    SELECT booking_id, SUM(payment_amount) as total_paid
    FROM tbl_payments
    WHERE payment_status IN ('completed', 'paid')
    GROUP BY booking_id
) p ON b.booking_id = p.booking_id
SET
    e.reserved_payment_total = COALESCE(p.total_paid, 0.00),
    e.adjusted_total = e.total_budget - COALESCE(p.total_paid, 0.00)
WHERE e.event_id = 256;
```

## Testing New Conversions

1. Create a new booking
2. Add reservation payment (e.g., ‚Ç±5,000)
3. Confirm booking
4. Convert to event
5. Check event details - "Reservation Fee" should show ‚Ç±5,000
6. Check database - `reserved_payment_total` should be 5000.00

## Next Steps

1. ‚úÖ **Run Migration Script** - Fix existing events
2. ‚úÖ **Test New Booking** - Verify new conversions work
3. ‚úÖ **Check Payment Summaries** - Verify display is correct
4. ‚úÖ **Monitor Logs** - Check for any errors in browser console
