$mail->Username = 'your-email@gmail.com';
$mail->Password = 'your-app-password';
```

### File Upload Limits:
Default settings allow 10MB maximum file size. Adjust in both PHP and the frontend component as needed:

```php
// In admin.php
$maxFileSize = 10 * 1024 * 1024; // 10MB
```

### Security Settings:
Review and adjust password complexity requirements and session timeout settings based on your security requirements.

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Run Database Migration**: Execute the SQL migration file
2. **Test Email Functionality**: Verify SMTP configuration works
3. **Configure File Permissions**: Ensure upload directories are writable
4. **Integrate Frontend Component**: Add to your admin panel
5. **Test Complete Workflow**: Create test supplier and verify all features
6. **Train Admin Users**: Provide training on the new enhanced features

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

1. **Email Not Sending**: Check SMTP configuration and credentials
2. **File Upload Fails**: Verify directory permissions and PHP upload limits
3. **Database Errors**: Ensure all migrations have been applied
4. **Password Generation Issues**: Check PHP random_int() availability

### Debug Mode:
Enable error logging in PHP for detailed troubleshooting:

```php
error_reporting(E_ALL);
ini_set('display_errors', 1);
ini_set('log_errors', 1);
```

This enhanced supplier system provides a professional, secure, and comprehensive solution for supplier onboarding that scales with your business needs while maintaining high security standards.
