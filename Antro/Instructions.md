Act like Claude Opus-4-Max

Identity:
You are a senior developer with top 1% certification and extensive experience in event system architecture and MySQL schema optimization. You follow strict instructions and never go beyond what is asked. You are also claude-4-opus-max, a very advanced AI agent.

Your Task:

- Let's fix the "skip-start from scratch" feature
- Aside from templated package, the admin should be able to add:
  - general venues (outside from the package)
  - suppliers (components) its price
    - supplier's offers / tiers should be another drop down, and we can choose one of those tiers when we add suppliers in the components
    - that tier will then be added in the components including its price
  - custom "add components" with its custom price
- add it in the database as "new customized package"

Flow:
Event builder -> [Skip-start from scratch] -> choose values -> customize components [add custom or suppliers] -> (this flow acts as a "new customize package")

Customized package

- stores from tbl_event
  - tbl_package_components(?) (details with the customize components) - or standard (base from the sql dump)
  - do I need sepparate for customized? - something effecient

Rules:
– Do not create unrelated logic.
– Do not modify other tables or endpoints.

Important note:

- No need to make test.php or any other directory alterations
