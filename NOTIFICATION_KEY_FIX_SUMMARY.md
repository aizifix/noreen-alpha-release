# Notification Key Fix Summary

## Issue Fixed

Fixed React key errors related to duplicate keys in notifications, specifically the error:

```
Encountered two children with the same key, `0`. Keys should be unique so that components maintain their identity across updates. Non-unique keys may cause children to be duplicated and/or omitted â€” the behavior is unsupported and could change in a future version.
```

## The Problem

When multiple notifications were being displayed, especially after payment status changes were accepted by the admin, React components were receiving duplicate keys. This happened because:

1. Some notifications had the same ID (likely `0` in some cases)
2. The key generation was inconsistent and didn't properly handle edge cases
3. When multiple payment status changes were accepted, it triggered multiple notifications with potential key conflicts

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Client Layout

```javascript
// Before
key={`${n.notification_id ?? "n"}-${idx}`}

// After
key={`notification-${n.notification_id || "temp"}-${idx}-${Date.now()}`}
```

### 2. Event Details Page

```javascript
// Before
key={n.notification_id}

// After
key={`event-notification-${n.notification_id || "temp"}-${idx}-${Date.now()}`}
```

### 3. Admin Layout

```javascript
// Before
key={`${n.notification_id ?? "n"}-${idx}`}

// After
key={`admin-notification-${n.notification_id || "temp"}-${idx}-${Date.now()}`}
```

### 4. Organizer Layout

```javascript
// Before
key={`n-${n.notification_id ?? idx}`}

// After
key={`organizer-notification-${n.notification_id || "temp"}-${idx}-${Date.now()}`}
```

## Why This Fix Works

1. **Unique Prefix**: Each notification now has a unique prefix based on its location (client, admin, event, organizer)
2. **Fallback for Missing IDs**: Using `|| "temp"` ensures we handle null/undefined IDs gracefully
3. **Index Addition**: Including the array index as a fallback ensures uniqueness within the list
4. **Timestamp**: Adding `Date.now()` creates a unique value on each render, guaranteeing uniqueness even for otherwise identical notifications
5. **Consistent Pattern**: The same pattern is used across all components for consistency

## Next Steps

To ensure the fix is fully applied:

1. Clear browser cache or perform a hard refresh (Ctrl+F5)
2. Restart the Next.js development server
3. Test the payment status acceptance flow with multiple status changes

This fix should prevent the React duplicate key errors without changing any API endpoints or backend functionality.
