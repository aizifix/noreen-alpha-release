# Venue Selection Fix - Quick Start Guide

## What Was Fixed

✅ **Problem**: Venues appeared in both "Venue Selection" AND "Package Inclusions" sections
✅ **Solution**: Venues now only appear in "Venue Selection" and are properly excluded from inclusions

✅ **Problem**: Venue prices weren't calculated based on guest capacity
✅ **Solution**: Venue costs now calculate: (price per pax × guests) + excess charges

✅ **Problem**: Budget didn't update when venue changed
✅ **Solution**: Budget automatically recalculates: Old Budget - Old Venue Cost + New Venue Cost

✅ **Problem**: No visibility into how changes affect paid amounts
✅ **Solution**: Shows old/new budget, amount paid, and new remaining balance

## Quick Test (5 Minutes)

### 1. Open an Event with a Package
```
Admin Dashboard → Events → Select any event with a package
```

### 2. Check Package Inclusions Section
**Look for**: "Package Inclusions" card
**Verify**:
- ❌ NO "hotel" listed
- ❌ NO "venue:" items
- ✅ ONLY catering, photography, decorations, etc.

### 3. Check Venue Selection Section
**Look for**: "Venue Selection" card
**Verify**:
- ✅ Venues listed here (e.g., Marco Hotel, Demiren Hotel)
- ✅ Shows "Current" badge on selected venue
- ✅ Each venue shows:
  - Price per pax (₱350.00 per pax)
  - Base Capacity (100)
  - Excess charge (+₱350.00 excess)
  - Capacity input box
  - Total calculation

### 4. Test Venue Change
**Steps:**
1. Click "Change Venue" button
2. Adjust "Capacity" input (e.g., change from 100 to 150)
3. Watch the "Total:" amount update dynamically
4. Click "Select" on a different venue
5. Read the success message

**Success Message Should Show:**
```
✅ Venue updated successfully. Total venue cost: ₱XX,XXX.XX

Budget increased/decreased from ₱XXX,XXX to ₱XXX,XXX
Amount paid: ₱XX,XXX (if any payments exist)
New remaining balance: ₱XXX,XXX
```

### 5. Verify Budget Update
**After venue change:**
1. Scroll to "Budget Progress" card at top
2. Verify "Total Budget" matches new amount
3. Check "Payment Summary" on right side
4. Verify "Remaining Balance" is correct

### 6. Verify No Duplication
**Final check:**
1. Refresh the page
2. Check Package Inclusions - still no hotel/venue? ✅
3. Check Venue Selection - venue still there? ✅
4. Check Budget - still correct? ✅

## Example Calculation

**Scenario**: Marco Hotel, Change from 100 to 150 guests

```
Marco Hotel Details:
- ₱350 per pax
- Base Capacity: 100
- Excess: ₱350 per guest over 100

Old Cost (100 guests):
  350 × 100 = ₱35,000

New Cost (150 guests):
  Base: 350 × 150 = ₱52,500
  Excess: (150-100) × 350 = ₱17,500
  Total: ₱70,000

Budget Change: +₱35,000
```

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Venue still shows in Package Inclusions
**Check**: Look at the component name in database
**Fix**: If it's an old event, may need to manually remove venue component

**SQL to check:**
```sql
SELECT component_name, component_price
FROM tbl_event_components
WHERE event_id = YOUR_EVENT_ID
AND (LOWER(component_name) LIKE '%hotel%'
     OR LOWER(component_name) LIKE '%venue%');
```

**SQL to fix (backup first!):**
```sql
DELETE FROM tbl_event_components
WHERE event_id = YOUR_EVENT_ID
AND (LOWER(component_name) LIKE '%hotel%'
     OR LOWER(component_name) LIKE '%venue%');
```

### Issue: Budget doesn't update
**Check browser console** for errors
**Check server logs** (admin.php) for SQL errors
**Verify**: Parameters are being sent in API request

### Issue: "Total:" shows ₱0.00
**Reason**: Venue might not have pricing set
**Check**: `tbl_venue_price` table has entry for this venue
**Fix**: Add venue pricing in admin venue management
