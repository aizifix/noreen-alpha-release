# Guest Count Lock Implementation

## Summary

This implementation fixes the guest count and pricing calculation bug in the Event Builder when creating events from confirmed/reserved bookings. The system now properly locks the guest count to prevent price reductions while allowing price increases for additional guests.

---

## Business Rules Implemented

### Rule 1: Guest Count Lock at Reservation
Once a booking reaches **RESERVED** or **CONFIRMED** status, the system locks:
- `reservedGuestCount` = Guest count at time of reservation
- `reservedEstimatedTotal` = Total price calculated at reservation
- `reservedPaymentTotal` = Reservation fee paid by client

### Rule 2: Guest Count Changes After Reservation

| Scenario | Current Count | Reserved Count | Action | Price Change |
|----------|--------------|----------------|--------|--------------|
| **Decrease** | 150 | 200 | Lock price at 200 guests | ‚ùå NO - stays at 200 guest price |
| **Decrease** | 100 | 200 | Lock price at 200 guests | ‚ùå NO - stays at 200 guest price |
| **Stay same** | 200 | 200 | No change | ‚ùå NO - stays at 200 guest price |
| **Increase** | 250 | 200 | Recalculate with 250 | ‚úÖ YES - increases to 250 guest price |
| **Increase** | 300 | 200 | Recalculate with 250 | ‚úÖ YES - increases to 300 guest price |

**Logic:**
```typescript
if (newGuestCount <= reservedGuestCount) {
  // Lock price - no refund for reducing guests
  effectiveGuestCount = reservedGuestCount;
} else {
  // Recalculate - charge for additional guests
  effectiveGuestCount = newGuestCount;
}
```

### Rule 3: Venue Changes After Reservation
Venue changes ARE allowed and recalculate using the **effective guest count** (locked or increased).

---

## Implementation Details

### 1. State Management

Added `reservedGuestCount` to the `reservedPaymentData` state:

```typescript
const [reservedPaymentData, setReservedPaymentData] = useState({
  reservedPayments: [] as any[],
  reservedPaymentTotal: 0,
  adjustedTotal: 0,
  clientFinalTotal: 0,
  reservedGuestCount: 0, // NEW: Locked guest count from booking
});
```

### 2. Venue Pricing Calculation

Updated `getTotalBudget()` function to implement guest count locking:

```typescript
// Venue components: handle venue buffer and overflow logic
if (component.category === "venue" && component.isVenueInclusion) {
  const venueRate = parseFloat(selectedVenue.extra_pax_rate || 0) || 0;
  const currentGuestCount = eventDetails.capacity || 100;
  const reservedGuestCount = reservedPaymentData.reservedGuestCount || 0;

  // Determine which guest count to use for calculation
  let effectiveGuestCount = currentGuestCount;
  let isGuestCountLocked = false;

  if (reservedGuestCount > 0) {
    if (currentGuestCount <= reservedGuestCount) {
      // Guest count decreased or stayed same - lock at reserved count (no refund)
      effectiveGuestCount = reservedGuestCount;
      isGuestCountLocked = true;
    } else {
      // Guest count increased - use new count (recalculate with increase)
      effectiveGuestCount = currentGuestCount;
      isGuestCountLocked = false;
    }
  }

  // Calculate actual venue cost: VenueRate √ó EffectiveGuestCount
  const actualVenueCost = venueRate * effectiveGuestCount;

  // Calculate excess payment: MAX(0, ActualVenueCost - VenueBuffer)
  const excessPayment = Math.max(0, actualVenueCost - venueBufferFee);
  venueNetCost = excessPayment;

  total += excessPayment;
}
```

### 3. Venue Inclusions Total Calculation

Updated `calculateVenueInclusionsTotal()` with the same logic:

```typescript
const calculateVenueInclusionsTotal = () => {
  let venueTotal = 0;

  if (selectedPackageId && originalPackagePrice != null) {
    if (selectedVenue && venueBufferFee !== null) {
      const venueRate = parseFloat(selectedVenue.extra_pax_rate || 0) || 0;
      const currentGuestCount = eventDetails.capacity || 100;
      const reservedGuestCount = reservedPaymentData.reservedGuestCount || 0;

      // Determine which guest count to use (same logic)
      let effectiveGuestCount = currentGuestCount;

      if (reservedGuestCount > 0) {
        if (currentGuestCount <= reservedGuestCount) {
          effectiveGuestCount = reservedGuestCount;
        } else {
          effectiveGuestCount = currentGuestCount;
        }
      }

      const actualVenueCost = venueRate * effectiveGuestCount;
      const excessPayment = Math.max(0, actualVenueCost - venueBufferFee);
      venueTotal = excessPayment;
    }
  }

  return venueTotal;
};
```

### 4. Booking Data Loading

Updated `loadBookingData()` to set the reserved guest count:

```typescript
// Set reserved payment data from booking
const reservedPayments = booking.payments || [];
const reservedPaymentTotal = booking.reserved_payment_total || 0;
const clientFinalTotal = booking.total_price || 0;
const reservedGuestCount = parsedGuestCount; // Lock the guest count from booking

setReservedPaymentData({
  reservedPayments,
  reservedPaymentTotal,
  adjustedTotal: 0,
  clientFinalTotal,
  reservedGuestCount, // NEW: Lock the guest count
});
```

Updated `lookupBookingByReference()` with the same logic.

### 5. Visual Indicators

Added UI indicators in the Event Summary sidebar to show when guest count is locked:

```typescript
{/* Guest Count Lock Indicator */}
{reservedPaymentData.reservedGuestCount > 0 && (
  <div className="flex justify-between bg-yellow-50 -mx-2 px-2 py-1.5 rounded border border-yellow-200">
    <span className="text-yellow-800 font-medium flex items-center gap-1">
      üîí Guest Count Locked:
    </span>
    <span className="font-semibold text-yellow-800">
      {reservedPaymentData.reservedGuestCount} guests
    </span>
  </div>
)}

{/* Guest Count Increase Indicator */}
{reservedPaymentData.reservedGuestCount > 0 &&
 eventDetails.capacity > reservedPaymentData.reservedGuestCount && (
  <div className="flex justify-between bg-orange-50 -mx-2 px-2 py-1.5 rounded border border-orange-200">
    <span className="text-orange-800 font-medium">
      ‚ö†Ô∏è Increased to:
    </span>
    <span className="font-semibold text-orange-800">
      {eventDetails.capacity} guests (+{eventDetails.capacity - reservedPaymentData.reservedGuestCount})
    </span>
  </div>
)}
```

## Example Scenarios

### Scenario A: Decreasing Guest Count (200 ‚Üí 100)

**Before Fix (WRONG):**
```
System recalculates: 100 √ó ‚Ç±350 = ‚Ç±35,000
‚Ç±35,000 - ‚Ç±35,000 (buffer) = ‚Ç±0
New price: ‚Ç±260,000 + ‚Ç±0 = ‚Ç±260,000
New balance: ‚Ç±260,000 - ‚Ç±20,000 = ‚Ç±240,000 ‚ùå
```

**After Fix (CORRECT):**
```
Reserved count: 200 guests
Current count: 100 guests
Effective count: 200 (LOCKED - no refund)

System calculates: 200 √ó ‚Ç±350 = ‚Ç±70,000
‚Ç±70,000 - ‚Ç±35,000 (buffer) = ‚Ç±35,000
Price: ‚Ç±260,000 + ‚Ç±35,000 = ‚Ç±295,000
Balance: ‚Ç±295,000 - ‚Ç±20,000 = ‚Ç±275,000 ‚úÖ

UI Shows: üîí Guest Count Locked: 200 guests
```

### Scenario B: Increasing Guest Count (200 ‚Üí 300)

**Before Fix (WRONG):**
```
System doesn't recalculate
Price stays at ‚Ç±275,000 ‚ùå
```

**After Fix (CORRECT):**
```
Reserved count: 200 guests
Current count: 300 guests
Effective count: 300 (RECALCULATE - additional charge)

System calculates: 300 √ó ‚Ç±350 = ‚Ç±105,000
‚Ç±105,000 - ‚Ç±35,000 (buffer) = ‚Ç±70,000
New price: ‚Ç±260,000 + ‚Ç±70,000 = ‚Ç±330,000
New balance: ‚Ç±330,000 - ‚Ç±20,000 = ‚Ç±310,000 ‚úÖ
Additional charge: ‚Ç±35,000 (difference from reserved)

UI Shows: ‚ö†Ô∏è Increased to: 300 guests (+100)
```

### Scenario C: Venue Change with Locked Guest Count

**Example:**
```
Reserved: 200 guests @ ‚Ç±350/guest
Change venue to: ‚Ç±400/guest
Current count: 150 guests (admin tried to reduce)

Effective count: 200 (LOCKED)

Calculation:
200 √ó ‚Ç±400 = ‚Ç±80,000
‚Ç±80,000 - ‚Ç±35,000 = ‚Ç±45,000
New Total: ‚Ç±260,000 + ‚Ç±45,000 = ‚Ç±305,000
New Balance: ‚Ç±305,000 - ‚Ç±20,000 = ‚Ç±285,000 ‚úÖ

Price increases by ‚Ç±10,000 from original booking
Guest count remains locked at 200
```

## Console Logging

The implementation includes detailed console logging for debugging:

```typescript
console.log(`üè¢ Venue pricing calculation (LOCKED GUEST COUNT LOGIC):
  - Venue: ${selectedVenue.venue_title}
  - Venue Rate: ‚Ç±${venueRate.toLocaleString()} per pax
  - Current Guest Count: ${currentGuestCount}
  - Reserved Guest Count: ${reservedGuestCount || 'N/A'}
  - Effective Guest Count: ${effectiveGuestCount} ${isGuestCountLocked ? 'üîí LOCKED' : '‚úì USING CURRENT'}
  - Reason: ${reservedGuestCount > 0 ?
      (currentGuestCount <= reservedGuestCount ?
        'No refund for reducing guests' :
        'Additional charge for increased guests') :
      'No reservation - using current count'}
  - Actual Venue Cost: ‚Ç±${venueRate.toLocaleString()} √ó ${effectiveGuestCount} = ‚Ç±${actualVenueCost.toLocaleString()}
  - Venue Buffer: ‚Ç±${venueBufferFee.toLocaleString()} (included in package)
  - Excess Payment: MAX(0, ‚Ç±${actualVenueCost.toLocaleString()} - ‚Ç±${venueBufferFee.toLocaleString()}) = ‚Ç±${excessPayment.toLocaleString()}
`);
```
