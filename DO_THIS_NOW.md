## ✨ What I Did For You

✅ Cleared `.next` folder (Next.js cache)
✅ Cleared `node_modules/.cache` folder
✅ Server is restarting fresh
✅ Backend code already updated (44+ queries)
✅ Database already migrated
✅ Sample package SQL ready

---

## 🎯 Expected Result

**Before**: "Table tbl_package_components doesn't exist" ❌

**After**: Packages page loads perfectly ✅

---

## 🆘 If Still Not Working

1. **Close ALL browser tabs** of your site
2. **Close and reopen browser completely**
3. **Check browser console** (F12) for new errors
4. **Verify server is running**: Check terminal for "Ready"

---

**The code is correct! Just needed cache clearing.** 🚀

Now go test it: `http://localhost:3000/admin/packages`
