Task
- When client books, the usually creates booking and its booking referrence, then reflects in the admin, and the client waits for confirmation

Problem that needs to be fix
- When accepting one booking, all other bookings gets accepted in the booking management page in the admin side.
- booking that are ACCEPTED should appear in the event creation when the admin "Look Up Existing Booking", a modal appears and the search button will appear, or when the admin search for the booking reference number or name of the one who books. Card with those details shows up, with the button "Create an Event". Once they click the details from that booking will "partially" populate the event builder - package choice, title, event type, and etc.,
- booking management page, when booking gets accepted only "View" and "Convert to event" button.
- change "Convert to event" button in to "Create an Event"

Rules
- FOCUS on the task I gave you
- DO NOT alter API endpoints
