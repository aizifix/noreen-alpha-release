- New Inclusion Budget: ‚Ç±70,000 + ‚Ç±15,000 = ‚Ç±85,000

‚úÖ Final Allocation:
- Venue Cost: ‚Ç±35,000  
- Inclusions: ‚Ç±85,000

### 4. INCLUSIONS & COMPONENTS
The Inclusion Budget (after venue computation) is distributed into categories and sub-components.

**Example:**
| Inclusion | Budget | Components |
|------------|----------|-------------|
| Photo & Video | ‚Ç±30,000 | Photographer, Videographer, Editor |
| Coordination & Styling | ‚Ç±25,000 | Planner, Coordinator, Florist, Stylist |
| Hair & Makeup | ‚Ç±15,000 | Bride HMUA, Groom HMUA |
| Entertainment | ‚Ç±15,000 | Host, DJ, Lights & Sound |

üí° System should allow Admin to adjust these allocations manually and visualize them on the pie chart as well.

- Venue cost is computed **per pax**, based on the selected venue.
- Any **unused venue budget** automatically returns to inclusions.
- Any **excess** is shown as ‚ÄúClient Additional Payment.‚Äù
- The total package budget always remains balanced and transparent.
